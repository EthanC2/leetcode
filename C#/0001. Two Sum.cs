/*
  This problem requires you to return the indices of two numbers in the vector<int> nums that will add up
  to the target value. The brute-force solution is check the sum of every element in the array for every 
  element in the array with a double for-loop, but that's an O(nÂ²) solution, and is an average solution.
  
  To solve this problem efficiently, you should use a hashmap (std::unordered_map) for their O(1) lookup time and associativity.
  You could use just std::map, but there's no reason to maintain order and trade an O(1) lookup time for O(log n).
  Using a hashmap will allow you to query whether or not a number `target_number - current_number` exists, which will
  always add to the target number. And, since you're using a hashmap of numbers mapped to indices, you can just query
  for the index of that number as soon as you know it exists.
  Honestly, I do have beef with this problem because it's far more efficient to return a std::pair or a std::tuple
  object and then use structured bindings (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201014-00/?p=104367) to unpack
  the object in the main function. Using a vector as the return value when the return value of the function will ALWAYS
  be only 2 std::size_t objects is a waste of memory.
  
  Also, the return type of this function (the int vector 'answer') should be `vector<std::size_t>` since they're indices.
