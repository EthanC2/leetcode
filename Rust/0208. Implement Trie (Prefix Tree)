use std::collections::HashMap;
/*
  A trie (also called a prefix tree) is a special data structure that is used for
  efficiently storing and retriving data with a significant amount of overlap. For 
  example, if you were to store an English dictionary in memory, you could use an 
  array or a hashset. However, since there is a significant amount of overlap in the
  English alphabet (only 26 letters in total), it would be much more efficient to
  store the dictionary in a tree-like structure where words that share a sequence
  of letters share a sequence of nodes. As a bonus, this structure allows you to
  search all words that begin with a given prefix like 'run' yielding 'runner',
  'runs', and 'runway'.
  
  Although tries are a bit more niche, they are incredibly useful in a number
  of powerful programs: autocomplete, ip routing, and spellcheck.
